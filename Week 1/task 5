# Softsinc Internship Program 2025 – Week 1

This repository documents my progress and projects completed during Week 1 of the **Softsinc Internship Program 2025** as an **AI/ML Internee**.

---

## 📁 Overview
The internship tasks are organized into modular Python scripts and notebooks across five key topics:

### 🔹 1. Advanced Python & CLI Tools
- Modular CLI app with:
  - Unit Converter (using `map` & `lambda`)
  - Calculator
  - File Organizer
  - Password Generator
- Features: error handling, directory operations, and command-line interactivity.

### 🔹 2. OOP with Real-World Design
- Class hierarchy: `User → Intern → Mentor`
- Implements inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- Simulated Chat App: Users, Managers, Messages with `__str__()` and flow logic

### 🔹 3. File & CSV Handling
- CSV analysis (missing values, unique entries)
- Generates reports with timestamps
- Log file summarizer that detects and counts error entries

### 🔹 4. Pandas Data Handling
- Titanic dataset used for EDA
- Tasks include groupby, filtering, data cleaning, visualization
- 5+ insights explored with visual support via Matplotlib/Seaborn

### 🔹 5. Git & GitHub Pro Workflow
- Branches: `main` and `dev`
- Daily commits to `dev`, merged to `main` at week-end
- Automated linter using **GitHub Actions** (`flake8`) for CI
